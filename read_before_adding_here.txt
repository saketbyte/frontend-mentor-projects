Make your project in a separate folder somewhere else or make it here/ Update the readme but you will need to update it later when you add the hosted website link so keep that in mind.
Then commit all the changes to this branch -master branch first.
Copy the new project files
and

and then make do git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

Now remove old files of this branch and then add your new project files here and commit to the new branch and push to the new branch.

Then go to netlify and host this branch, no need to add anything like base directory etc. Simply host it.
